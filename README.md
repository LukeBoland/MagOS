Is writing an OS in RUST a good idea? Maybe.

Is ME writing an OS in RUST a good idea? Certainly not.

This repository provides public access to my code as I attempt to follow along with the instructions for [BlogOS](https://os.phil-opp.com/) by Philipp Oppermann live on [stream](http://tehmagilla.live).

Along the way I should learn a lot about Rust, Operating Systems, and the limits of my patience.

I do not vouch for the quality OR validity of my code, or whatever it may produce.

Disclaimer: the code in this repository may: delete your files; cause physical damage to system components; make your eyes bleed; sleep with your partner; kill your car; steal your dog; cause unexpected explosive diarrhea; spark nuclear war; or in extreme cases, refuse to compile. I offer NO warranties (express OR implied).

Milestones
